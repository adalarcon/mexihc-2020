              <h3 class="title">Objectives</h3>
              <p>
                The main objectives of the Student Design Competition are to provide an opportunity for students of Human-Computer Interaction and related fields (e. g. Computer Science, interaction and visual design, Psychology, Social Sciences, among others) to participate in a practical activity and to demonstrate their skills in problem solving, interaction design and user experience. Also, to create an exhibition space of solutions to a real-world challenge using myriad approaches (design research, brainstorming, prototyping, implementation, evaluation, among others); and, to foster greater interaction between industry representatives and students.
              </p>
              <h3 class="title">The Design Challenge: Inclusion</h3>
              <p>
                In this Student Design Competition, we encourage you to contribute with ‘Inclusion’: use human-centred design approaches to develop a new way (e.g., a product, interface, system or service) to support, empower, or alleviate the physical, psychological or social challenges around this theme. The scope of this design challenge is broad: for example, you could focus on healthcare, education, public services, charity, food, poverty, or art, just to name a few. You can either work with a particular inclusion/ exclusion situation (e.g., digital inclusion of a specific community) or you could work with a broader issue (e.g., social inclusion of minority groups). You may adopt different design strategies, including participatory design, co-creation and co-design, service design, design for social innovation, inclusive design and open innovation. You may come up with a participatory design and co-creation approach using existing technologies or you may find opportunity in contemporary developments in technology, such as 3D printing, digital fabrication, citizen sensing, the maker movement, the sharing economy, big data, social networks, IoT, gamification, new sensors and actuators, and Augmented Reality, to name just a few.              </p>
              <p>
                We particularly encourage that the following criteria be considered:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Does the design solution address a real challenge or challenges of people in inclusion/ exclusion situation?</li>
                <li>Does the design solution use technology in an appropriate and novel way?</li>
                <li>Was relevant prior work properly identified and cited?</li>
                <li>Were analysis, synthesis, design and evaluation both systematic and sufficient?</li>
                <li>Were the research process and the involvement of stakeholders ethically appropriate (e.g., were institutional guidelines followed)?</li>
                <li>Were genuine stakeholders involved in the process of research, development and evaluation?</li>
                <li>Did the team explore the entire ecosystem of stakeholders, conditions, and contexts?</li>
                <li>Was the design solution well-crafted and effectively presented?</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="title">Important Dates</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>June 19th, 2020 – Submission deadline (12pm (noon) PDT / 3pm EDT).</li>

                <li>August 14th, 2020 – Camera-ready submission.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="title">Student Team Requirements</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>Groups of up 4 students with one supervisor (5 participants max).</li>
                  <li>Each team must have at least one student and one supervisor.</li>
                  <li>Each supervisor can mentor only one team.</li>
                  <li>The supervisor may be a professor or an industry professional.</li>
                  <li>Submissions are invited from all students at all stages of their university careers, from undergraduate to postgraduate. While not a mandatory requirement, it is strongly encouraged that the teams put forward a multidisciplinary team.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="title">Submission Details</h3>
              <p>
                Each group must submit a presentation with a maximum of 15 slides, a written report of up to 4 pages in ACM Proceedings Format describing in more detail the points raised in the presentation; written in one of the both languages: Spanish or English; and, in PDF format.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both documents should describe:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The Problem addressed.</li>
                <li>The Social impact of the proposed solution in the Mexican context.</li>
                <li>The Process used during the project.</li>
                <li>The Methodology, methods, and techniques used.</li>
                <li>The Description of the target audience.</li>
                <li>The Proposed solution.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Additionally, we encourage the team to provide a supplementary video (max 5 minutes), illustrating how your solution fits the lives of people in an inclusion/ exclusion situation with the help of scenarios. Even though the supplementary video is optional, it can help the jury to understand your proposed solution better. In any case, the selection process will be based on the two mandatory files (presentation and written report).
              </p>

              <p>
                As with other submissions sent to MexIHC 2020, the Students Design Competition entries should not have been previously accepted for presentation or publication in any other event.
              </p>

              <p>
                The accepted submission will be published in the journal Avances en Interacción Humano-Computadora (AIHC) of AmexIHC, for which the final format of the manuscript must follow the proper template.
              </p>

              <p>
                We will accept submission in ACM and AmexIHC format. However, we appreciate if you can already send your submission in the AmexIHC format.
              </p>
